Welcome to while Loop Tutorial, a game designed to teach you about while loops.
2 1 3
There are two kinds of loops: for loops and while loops.
3 1 4
For loops are more complicated to construct, so are being reserved for a later discussion.
4 2 5 6
Let's start with the if statement. Do you know what if statements are for? (1: Yes, 2: No)
5 1 13
Good! Then we will move on.
6 1 7
That's fine. I will give a basic overview.
7 1 8
An if statement is a conditional branch.
8 1 9
Depending on the input to the if statement, the code under it will execute only if the input is true.
9 1 10 1
if (true) {code;} else {other code;}
10 1 11
The above demonstrates this. The other code in the else branch only executes if the input isn't true.
11 1 12 1
 
12 1 13
With this out of the way, we will move on to while loops.
13 1 14
A while loop can be considered to be a repeated if statement.
14 1 15
It is called a "loop" because the code inside repeats so long as the statement holds true, rather than executing once.
15 1 16
In the course of the while loop, things can change, which may change the result. Consider the following code:
16 1 17 1
i = 1; while (i < 3) {i++;}
17 1 18
In the above, i increases by 1 as long as i < 3.
18 1 19
Given this information, how many times will the loop body in brackets run?
19 3 20 23 21
(1: Once, 2: Twice, 3: Thrice)
20 1 24
That's not quite true, unfortunately. The answer is two, as the loop executes for i = 1 and i = 2.
21 1 22
That's not quite true, unfortunately.
22 1 24
The check "i < 3" is run three times, but it's false the last time, so the inside runs twice.
23 1 24
Correct! This is because the loop executes twice when i = 1 and i = 2.
24 1 25 1
 
25 1 26
This concludes the basic overview of while loops. They are very powerful for repeating actions.

Would you like to play the tutorial again? (1: Yes, 2: No)
27 1 28
Alright. By the way, this can be considered one giant while loop which executes as long as you want to replay.

On that note...

Cool. Thanks for playing! You can quit the game now.
